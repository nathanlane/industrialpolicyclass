# Industrial Policy Module - Oxford
Industrial development and industrial policy class.

This is a course webpage, together with the Canvas page, dedicated to the Industrial Development module 

# Syllabus 


This module is about industrial policy and industrial development. Or more precisely, how the former causes and leads to the latter. We will explore how policy has played a role in shaping the structural transformation, in particular how they promote (or stymied) industrial development.


This class is an excellent follow-up to Douglas Gollin's Structural Transformation. But of course, this is not necessary. In general, the subject matter and the content will be quite similar. This course will be empirically focused. We will revisit the core ideas about industrial policy, with a goal of thinking about empirics. Specifically, modern empirics.

Industrial policy is an old idea. Perhaps as old as the institutions of capitalism itself. Even though countries pursue industrial development through industrial policy.
