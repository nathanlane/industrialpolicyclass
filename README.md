## Industrial Policy and Development Introduction

This module is about industrial policy and industrial development. More precisely, how the former is used to promote the latter. We will study the means by which states encourage (or, in practice, stymie) the evolution of industry, and shape the composition of economic activity within a national economy. In doing so we will attempt to understand the practice of industrial policy; the arguments for and against; and the ways in which we can start thinking about industrial policies empirically.

This class will focus on practice and evidence. While this classe will cover the theoretical arguments behind industrial policy, the focus will be on attempts to evaluate the impact of these policies. The goal is to consider how scholars, practitioners, and policymakers might evaluate the efficacy of the policies. This class is an excellent follow-up to Douglas Gollin's Structural Transformation module. Trade may be a good one too. However, none of these are necessary.

### Objectives

The objectives of this course is to understand core concepts around the industrial promotion. This a short course, thus it is not exhaustive. My goal is to clarify concepts and issues at the heart of this literature and concept. Some of these objectives include understanding,

- Horizontal vs. verticle targeting.
- Policy levers associated with industrial policy interventions. Including subsidies, tariffs, quotas.
- Command of the political economy issues surrounding implementation, failure, and capture.
- Frictions and external economy arguments of behind interventions.
- Consuming and evaluating the efficacy of research around industrial policy. Including the outcomes associated with industrial policy. 
- Trade policy and its relationship to industrial policy.
- Input-output linkages.

## Schedule and Structure 

### Timeline

This module for the development economics MSc. will take place the second half of Oxford's Hilary term. The meeting times are as follows. Of course, the world is crumbling right now, so this may change.

- Week 6 - Main lecture 1 - Friday, 11:15 AM - 1:15 PM 
- Week 7 - Short Lecture 1 - Thurday, 3:30 PM - 4:30 PM
- Week 7 - Main lecture 2 -  Friday, 11:15 AM - 1:15 PM 
- Week 8 - Short Lecture 2 - Thurday, 3:30 PM - 4:30 PM
- Week 8 - Main lecture 3 -  Friday, 11:15 AM - 1:15 PM 
- Week 9 - Short Lecture 3 - Thurday, 3:30 PM - 4:30 PM
- Week 9 - Main lecture 4 -  Friday, 11:15 AM - 1:15 PM 
- Week 9 - Short lecture 4 - Saturday, 12:00 Noon - 1:00 PM


I will also schedule some revision sessions in Trinity Term for students who might want to talk through particular sample essay topics to prepare for exams. These will are TBD. Watch this space.

### Structure and Organization  

The module is composed of four blocks. Each block corresponds consisting of a two-hour lecture (_"main lecture"_) and a one-hour class (_"short lecture"_). 

The course is structured around four themese in industrial policy and development. The contents of these blocks may change slightly, as this is a new class. 

- __Block 1:__ Introducing the ideas of industrial policy and its relationship to industrial development. 

- __Block 2:__ Dynamic externalities and learning-by-doing. We'll explore the justifications for industrial development, revisiting the arguments for interventions.  

- __Block 3:__ The role of trade activity and trade policy as means of industrial development. How domestic industrial development interacts with global product markets. 

- __Block 4:__ Network externalities, linkages, and clusters.

## Office Hours, Communication, & Advising.

__E-Mail__ - It always helps to refer to the module in the header of your mail (__"Industrial Policy Class..."__). I do my best to answer e-mails promptly, but if for some reason you do not get a response, just nudge me. Especially with remote teaching, it's (sadly) not uncommon for things to fall through the cracks.

__Office Hours__  -  I will hold regular teaching office hours each week. You do not need an appointment to see me during offce hours. Just come by and knock. If I am with another student, you may have to wait momentarily. Offce hours are intended for relatively short questions and interactions. For extended discussions, please email me for an appointment. 

For convenience, office hours will be held at my Merton College office (_Fellows Quad, Staircase 4, Room 4.8_), around the corner from the Exam School lectures. I figure this is easier and more accessible than my office in the economics department. My college office is located on the Merton College grounds, Staircase 4, Office 4.8. _Given the UK government is radically determined to keep the pandemic burning, it may be that office hours will just be Zoom hours_, in which case these issues are moot. I will post the Zoom link accordingly here and on Canvas.

### Office Hours Hilary Term

## Schedule of Main Lectures.
Main lectures are two-hour lectures and discussions. 

Please note that the lectures may cover additional papers and omit some of these. Each lecture will have its own list of references. If you are in doubt about what reading to do, please ask me. If you track the required readings, you will be set.

### Readings 
Readings are broken down by those required for the command of lecture material. Lectures will draw heavily from required readings. Followed by those that are great follow ups for enrichment. Further readings are for those who want to get into the weeds of a topic. 

Industrial policy is an old idea. In a sense, these policies are as old as the institutions of capitalism. Nevetherless, as a subject of inquirty, industrial development and industrial policy has waxed and waned in popularity. With this in mind, the following syllabus might look a little different than most. You'll see many old papers about theories, with a smattering of fairly recents empirical paper. Don't be deceived by an older paper. It's punchline may still be worthwhile.

Some of the papers you see may also seem unorthodox. Dare I see too "policy oriented." The diversity of the reading list is a reflection of the state of the literature. In the context of industrialisation and industrial development, many of these ideas are just now starting to be considered. 

### Part 1 - Concepts, Controversies, and the State
Introduction to industrial policy as a concept--and controversies. This will serve as an entry point for creating a taxonomy of the justifications for (and against) these interventions. We will end by trying to focus on the political economy of these policies.

### Part 2 - Externalities - Infant Industries, Learning-by-Doing, and Scale Economies. 
In this section we get more precise about the nature of externalities. We focus on two types of externalities associated with justifications of industrial policy: learning-by-doing and scale economies. The latter, is an entry point into thinking about place-based policies.

### Part 3 - Externalities - Network Spillovers, Clusters, and Foreign Direct Investment.
- The old and new: linkages. Linkages have an old idea in development economics. How to think about them, what do they mean, what is current work saying? This will include how to think the practicalities of the input-output table, and how they're used in discussing industrial policy practice. We will used the old idea of linkages to also consider the role they play in foreign direct investment (FDI).

### Part 4 - Trade - Protectionism, ISI, and Export-Led Industrial Development
Industrial development and trade have a long history. They're innately intertwined. Here we talk about the industrial policy in terms of trade policy. Principally by juxtaposing import substitution verses export promotion. The discussion of export-focused IP dovetails with with our discussion of.

## Schedule of Tutorial Lectures.

### Week 1 - Political Economy of Industrial Policy and Controversies.

- Government Failures and Rent-Seeking
- Information and Political Economy.
- Justin Lin vs. HJ Chang.

### Week 2 - Place-Based Industrial Policy and Empirics.
Place-based policies are closely related to industrial development. They are a lot like industrial policy _writ large_, but also represent some of their own challenges.

- Characterize the debate between Tim Bartik. Relate this to the discussion of industrial policy broadly.
- Place-based industrial subsidies in the UK.
- Italian lessons on regional development.
- Special enterprize zones. 

### Week 3 - Industrial Networks.
Networks get a little more complicated. Especially when we consider them in general equilibrium models. This section is about taking some deep dives into 

- Ernest Liu's network model. Can be shared. 
- General equilibrium and IO models.
- Crowding out and general equilibrium effects of subsidies. 

### Week 4 - Export-Promotion and Empirics.
There has been a ton of work on export-oriented policies. While trade policies have.

- Why export?
- Economic complexity and export performance.
- What does export credit do?
- Scale economies and growth.
