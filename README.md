# Industrial Policy Module - Oxford
Industrial development and industrial policy class.

This is a course webpage, together with the Canvas page, dedicated to the Industrial Development module 

# Syllabus 


This module is about industrial policy and industrial development. Or more precisely, how the former causes and leads to the latter. We will explore how policy has played a role in shaping the structural transformation, in particular how they promote (or stymied) industrial development.


This class is an excellent follow-up to Douglas Gollin's Structural Transformation Module. Trade may be a good one too. But none of these are necessary. In general, the subject matter and the content will be quite similar. This course will be empirically focused. We will revisit the core ideas about industrial policy, with a goal of thinking about empirics. Specifically, modern empirics.

Industrial policy is an old idea. Perhaps as old as the institutions of capitalism itself. Even though countries pursue industrial development through industrial policy, and never stopped doing so, industrial development and industrial policy has waxed and waned in popularity. With this in mind, the syllabus may look a little strange. You'll see a lot of old papers about theories, with a smattering of fairly recents empirical papers. It's not because I think it's cool _per se_ to read old economics papers, but because a lot of these ideas have only started to be tested recently.
