## Industrial Policy Class Introduction

This module is about industrial policy and industrial development. More precisely, how the former is used to promote the latter. We will study the means by which states encourage (or, in practice, stymie) the evolution of industry, and shape the composition of economic activity within a national economy. We will study that governments use to do so; the arguments for and against; why have these interventions been controversial, and why are they still.

This module will approach this subject from an empirical angle. While this classe will cover the theoretical arguments behind industrial policy, the focus will be on econometric evidence, and reviewing recent econometric evidence around policies. The goal is to consider how scholars, practitioners, and policymakers might evaluate the efficacy of the policies. This class is an excellent follow-up to Douglas Gollin's Structural Transformation module. Trade may be a good one too. However, none of these are necessary.

Industrial policy is an old idea. In a sense, as old as the institutions of capitalism. Nevetherless, as a subject studied by economists, industrial development and industrial policy has waxed and waned in popularity. With this in mind, the syllabus might look a little different than most. You'll see many old papers about theories, with a smattering of fairly recents empirical paper. Some of the papers you see may also seem unorthodox. Dare I see too "policy oriented." The diversity of the reading list is a reflection of the state of the literature. In the context of industrialisation and industrial development, many of these ideas are just now starting to be considered.


## Schedule and Structure 

### Timeline

This module for the development economics MSc. will take place the second half of Oxford's Hilary term. The meeting times are as follows. Of course, the world is crumbling right now, so this may change.

- Week 6 - Main lecture 1 - Friday, 11:15 AM - 1:15 PM 
- Week 7 - Short Lecture 1 - Thurday, 3:30 PM - 4:30 PM
- Week 7 - Main lecture 2 -  Friday, 11:15 AM - 1:15 PM 
- Week 8 - Short Lecture 2 - Thurday, 3:30 PM - 4:30 PM
- Week 8 - Main lecture 3 -  Friday, 11:15 AM - 1:15 PM 
- Week 9 - Short Lecture 3 - Thurday, 3:30 PM - 4:30 PM
- Week 9 - Main lecture 4 -  Friday, 11:15 AM - 1:15 PM 
- Week 9 - Short lecture 4 - Saturday, 12:00 Noon - 1:00 PM


I will also schedule some revision sessions in Trinity Term for students who might want to talk through particular sample essay topics to prepare for exams. These will are TBD. Watch this space.

### Structure and Organization  

The module is composed of four blocks. Each block corresponds consisting of a two-hour lecture (_"main lecture"_) and a one-hour class (_"short lecture"_). 

The course is structured around four themese in industrial policy and development. The contents of these blocks may change slightly, as this is a new class. 

- __Block 1:__ Introducing the ideas of industrial policy and its relationship to industrial development. 

- __Block 2:__ Dynamic externalities and learning-by-doing. We'll explore the justifications for industrial development, revisiting the arguments for interventions.  

- __Block 3:__ The role of trade activity and trade policy as means of industrial development. How domestic industrial development interacts with global product markets. 

- __Block 4:__ Network externalities, linkages, and clusters. 


## Office Hours & Communication

__E-mail__ - It always helps to refer to the module in the header of your mail (__"Industrial Policy Class..."__). I do my best to answer e-mails promptly, but if for some reason you do not get a response, just nudge me. Especially with remote teaching, it's (sadly) not uncommon for things to fall through the cracks.

__Office Hours__  -  I will hold regular teaching office hours each week. You do not need an appointment to see me during offce hours. Just come by and knock. If I am with another student, you may have to wait momentarily. Offce hours are intended for relatively short questions and interactions. For extended discussions, please email me for an appointment. 

For convenience, office hours will be held at my Merton College office (_Fellows Quad, Staircase 4, Room 4.8_), around the corner from the Exam School lectures. I figure this is easier and more accessible than my office in the economics department. My college office is located on the Merton College grounds, Staircase 4, Office 4.8. _Given the UK government is radically determined to keep the pandemic burning, it may be that office hours will just be Zoom hours_, in which case these issues are moot. I will post the Zoom link accordingly here and on Canvas.

### Office Hours Hilary Term

## Schedule of Lectures and Readings

Please note that the lectures may cover additional papers and omit some of these; each lecture will have its own list of references. If you are in doubt about what reading to do, please ask me. Just shoot me an email. 

### Block 1 - Concepts, Controversies, and a Contested Domain.
In the first part we will discuss what all this means. We'll fix ideas and talk through what all this is about. 

- Industrial Policy and Industrial Development - What and Why?
Introduction to industrial policy as a concept. Why does industrial development matter in the grande scheme of things. 

- Historical Context, Debates, Justifications. 
Industrial policy has been quite controversial. Here we turn to the justifications of industrial policy and interventions to address industrial development. We also try to categorise and classify some of the justifications for these policies. These justifications will form the backbone of what we'll discuss throughout the class. 

### Block 2 - Infant Industries, Dynamic Externalities, and Learning-by-Doing.

- 

- Learning-by-Doing


### Lecture - Evidence Around Industrial Policy? What is working?


## Part 3 - Trade - Imports, Exports, Policy
Industrial development and trade have a long history. They're innately intertwined. Here we talk about the industrial policy in terms of trade policy. Principally by juxtaposing import substitution verses export promotion. The former is intimately tied to input 

### 3.1 - Why Trade Policy? 
What _is_ the difference between trade policy and industrial policy. 

### 3.2 - Imports - Import Substitution (ISI), Protection, and Liberalisation of Inputs

### 3.3 - Export - Export-led Growth, Export Promotion Policy

### Lecture - Empirical Papers and Evidence

## Part 4 - Networks, Clusters, and The State
