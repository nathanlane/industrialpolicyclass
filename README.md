## Industrial Policy and Development Introduction

This module is about industrial policy and industrial development. More precisely, how the former is used to promote the latter. We will study the means by which states encourage (or, in practice, stymie) the evolution of industry, and shape the composition of economic activity within a national economy. In doing so we will attempt to understand the practice of industrial policy; the arguments for and against; and the ways in which we can start thinking about industrial policies empirically.

This class will focus on practice and evidence. While this classe will cover the theoretical arguments behind industrial policy, we will nevertheless focus on attempts to empirically examine industrial policy. The goal is to consider how scholars, practitioners, and policymakers might evaluate the efficacy of the policies. This class is an excellent follow-up to Douglas Gollin's Structural Transformation module. Trade may be a good one too. However none of these are necessary.


### Objectives

The objectives of this course is to understand core concepts around industrial promotion policies relationship to developing economies. This course is new and short, and thus not exhaustive. The goal is to give broad conceptual clarity and review issues at the heart of this literature. Some of the objectives include understanding

- horizontal vs. vertical targeting and policies.
- industrial policy levers - including subsidies, tariffs, quotas.
- static versus dynamic comparative advantage and welfare concepts.
- frictions and external economy arguments of behind interventions.
- political economy and government failures and critiques of policy.
- trade policy and its relationship to industrial policy. 
- the role of trade and industrial development outcomes.
- input-output linkages and economies of scale concepts.

## Schedule and Structure 

This module is for the Development Economics MSc. and will take place the second half of Oxford's Hilary term (weeks 6-8). 

The meeting times are as follows (in the Online MScED Zoom Room)

- Week 5 - Lecture 1 - Friday, 3.00–5.00pm (GMT) 
- Week 6 - Class 1 - Thurday, 3.30–4.30pm (GMT) 
- Week 6 - Lecture 2 -  Friday, 3.00–5.00pm (GMT) 
- Week 8 - Class 2 - Thurday, 3.30–4.30pm (GMT) 
- Week 8 - Lecture 3 -  Friday, 3.00–5.00pm (GMT)  
- Week 9 - Class 3 - Thurday, 3.30–4.30pm (GMT) 
- Week 9 - Lecture 4 -  Friday, 3.00–5.00pm (GMT) 
- Week 8 - Class 4 - __Saturday__, 10.30am–11.30am (GMT) _(Week 8 only)_ 

I will also schedule revision sessions in Trinity Term for students who might want to talk through particular sample essay topics and to prepare for exams. These dates are TBD. Watch this space.

## Structure and Organization  

The module is composed of four blocks. Each block has a theme, which I cover in 1) the main two-hour lecture and 2) a supplementary one-hour class 

- __Block 1:__ Introducing the ideas of industrial policy and its relationship to industrial development. 

- __Block 2:__ Dynamic externalities and learning-by-doing. We'll explore the justifications for industrial development, revisiting the arguments for interventions.  

- __Block 3:__ The role of trade activity and trade policy as means of industrial development. How domestic industrial development interacts with global product markets. 

- __Block 4:__ Network externalities, linkages, and clusters. 

The contents of these blocks may change slightly, as this is a new class. So please keep an eye on the "living" syllabus on this page. I will try to update you on substantive changes as they arise.

## Office Hours, Communication, & Advising.

__E-Mail__ - It always helps to refer to the module in the header of your mail (__"Industrial Policy Class..."__). 

I do my best to answer e-mails quickly. If for some reason you do not get a response, just nudge me. Especially with remote teaching, it's not uncommon for things to fall through the cracks.

__Office Hours__  -  I usually hold regular teaching office hours each week. You do not need an appointment to see me during offce hours. I will provide a link to the Zoom office hours room for this. 

You can also schedule individual Zoom meetings with me for more extensive discussions. Just email me.

- Week 6 - Thursday, 5:30 PM - 6:00 PM 
- Week 7 - Thursday, 5:30 PM - 6:00 PM 
- Week 8 - Thursday, 5:30 PM - 6:00 PM 
- Week 9 - Thursday, 5:30 PM - 6:00 PM

## Schedule of Main Lectures.
The main class each week will consist of a two-hour lecture. Lectures will usually be broken into two topics or so. Please note that the lectures may cover additional papers and omit some of those on the list. Each lecture will also have its own list of references, which I will give at the end of each set of lectures. 

If you are in doubt about what reading to do, please ask me. If you track the required readings, you will be set. I will try to post slides and/or notes after the lectures. 

### Readings 
Readings are broken down by those required for the command of lecture material. Lectures will draw heavily from required readings. Followed by those that are great follow ups for enrichment. Further readings are for those who want to get into the weeds of a topic. 

Industrial policy is an old idea. In a sense, these policies are as old as the institutions of capitalism. Nevetherless, as a subject of inquirty, industrial development and industrial policy has waxed and waned in popularity. With this in mind, the following syllabus might look a little different than most. You'll see many old papers about theories, with a smattering of fairly recents empirical paper. Don't be deceived by an older paper. It's punchline may still be worthwhile.

Some of the papers you see may also seem unorthodox. Dare I see too "policy oriented." The diversity of the reading list is a reflection of the state of the literature. In the context of industrialisation and industrial development, many of these ideas are just now starting to be considered. 


### Part 1 - Concepts, Controversies, and the State
Introduction to industrial policy as a concept--and the controversies surrounding it. The goal of this class will be to organize the taxonomy of the justifications for (and against) these interventions. Specifically, the various market failures and imperfections that are justifications for these policies.

### Part 2 - Externalities - Infant Industries, Learning-by-Doing, and Scale Economies. 
In this section we get more precise about a set of key externalities underlying arguments for industrial policy for industrial development. We focus on two types of externalities associated with justifications of industrial policy: learning-by-doing and scale economies. The latter, is an entry point into thinking about place-based policies.

### Part 3 - Externalities - Network Linkages, Clusters, and Foreign Direct Investment.
- The old and new: linkages. Linkages have an old idea in development economics. How to think about them, what do they mean, what is current work saying? This will include how to think the practicalities of the input-output table, and how they're used in discussing industrial policy practice. We will used the old idea of linkages to also consider the role they play in foreign direct investment (FDI).

### Part 4 - Trade - Protectionism, ISI, and Export-Led Industrial Development
Industrial development and trade have a long history. They're innately intertwined. Here we talk about the industrial policy in terms of trade policy. Principally by juxtaposing import substitution verses export promotion. The discussion of export-focused IP dovetails with with our discussion of.

### Part 2 - Place-Based Industrial Policy and Empirics.
