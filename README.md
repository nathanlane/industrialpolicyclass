# Industrial Policy Module - Oxford
Industrial development and industrial policy class.

This is a course webpage, together with the Canvas page, dedicated to the Industrial Development module 

# Syllabus 

This module is about industrial policy and industrial development. Or more precisely, how the former causes and leads to the latter. We will explore how policy has played a role in shaping the structural transformation, in particular how they promote (or stymied) the development of industries. 

This class is an excellent follow-up to Douglas Gollin's Structural Transformation Module. Trade may be a good one too. But none of these are necessary. In general, the subject matter and the content will be quite similar. This course will be empirically focused. We will revisit the core ideas about industrial policy, with a goal of thinking about empirics. Specifically, modern empirics.

Industrial policy is an old idea. Perhaps as old as the institutions of capitalism itself. Even though countries pursue industrial development through industrial policy, and never stopped doing so, industrial development and industrial policy has waxed and waned in popularity. With this in mind, the syllabus may look a little strange. You'll see a lot of old papers about theories, with a smattering of fairly recents empirical papers. It's not because I think it's cool _per se_ to read old economics papers, but because a lot of these ideas have only started to be tested recently. 

This readings in this class will seem a bit unorthodox. It's a class on concepts and policies that are operating, but one where economic research has (relatively-speaking) had little to say.

## Office Hours & Communication

__E-mail__ - It always helps to refere to the module in the header of your mail. I do my best to answer those e-mails promptly, but if for some reason you do not get a response, just nudge me. 

__Office Hours__  -  I hold regular teaching office hours each week. You do not need an appointment to see me during offce hours. Just come by and knock.  If I am with another student, you may have to wait momentarily. Offce hours are intended for relatively short questions and interactions. For extended discussions, please email me for an appointment. 

For convenience, office hours will be held at my Merton College office (_Fellows Quad, Staircase 4, Room 4.8_), around the corner from the Exam School (where lectures will take place). I figure this is easier and more accessible than my office in the economics department. My college office is located on the Merton College grounds, Staircase 4, Office 4.8. _Given the UK government is radically determined to keep the pandemic burning, it may be that office hours will just be Zoom hours_, in which case these issues are moot and I will post the Zoom link accordingly.

# Schedule of Lectures and Readings

Please note that the lectures may cover additional papers and omit some of these; each lecture will have its own list of references. If you are in doubt about what reading to do, please ask me. Just shoot me an email. 

## Part 1 - Concepts, Controversies, and a Contested Domain.
In the first part we will discuss what all this means. We'll fix ideas and talk through what all this is about. 

### 1.1 - Industrial Policy and Industrial Development - What and Why?
Introduction to industrial policy as a concept. Why does industrial development matter in the grande scheme of things. 

### 1.2 - Historical Context, Debates, Justifications. 
Industrial policy has been quite controversial. Here we turn to the justifications of industrial policy and interventions to address industrial development. We also try to categorise and classify some of the justifications for these policies. These justifications will form the backbone of what we'll discuss throughout the class. 

### Lecture - Evidence Past and Present - What are the issues?


## Part 2 - 


### 2.1 - 

### 2.2 - 

### Lecture - Evidence Around Industrial Policy? What is working?


## Part 3 - Trade - Imports, Exports, Policy
Industrial development and trade have a long history. They're innately intertwined. Here we talk about the industrial policy in terms of trade policy. Principally by juxtaposing import substitution verses export promotion. The former is intimately tied to input 

### 3.1 - Why Trade Policy? 
What _is_ the difference between trade policy and industrial policy. 

### 3.2 - Imports - Import Substitution (ISI), Protection, and Liberalisation of Inputs

### 3.3 - Export - Export-led Growth, Export Promotion Policy

### Lecture - Empirical Papers and Evidence

## Part 4 - Networks, Clusters, and The State
