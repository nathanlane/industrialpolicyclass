## Industrial Policy Module Introduction

This module is about industrial policy and industrial development. More precisely, how the former is used to promote the latter. We will study the means by which states encourage (or, historically, stymie) the evolution of industry, and shape the composition of economic activity. In doing so, we will attempt to understand the practice of industrial policy; the arguments for and against; and the ways in which we can start thinking about industrial policies empirically.

This class will focus on practice and evidence. While this class covers theoretical arguments behind industrial policy, the focus will be on empirics. More precisely, how scholars, practitioners, and policymakers might evaluate the efficacy of these policies. This class is an excellent follow-up to Douglas Gollin's Structural Transformation module and complements Christian Meyer's labour and firms module. However, none of these are necessary.


### Objectives

The objective of this course is to understand core concepts around industrial promotion policies in developing economies. This module is new. And it is also short. Thus, it is not exhaustive. Accordingly, the goal is to provide broad, conceptual clarity of main ideas and to review issues at the heart of this literature. 

Some of the objectives include understanding

- horizontal vs. vertical targeting and policies.
- industrial policy levers - including subsidies, tariffs, quotas.
- static versus dynamic comparative advantage and welfare concepts.
- frictions and external economy arguments of behind interventions.
- political economy and government failures and critiques of policy.
- trade policy and its relationship to industrial policy. 
- the role of trade and industrial development outcomes.
- input-output linkages and economies of scale concepts.

The meeting times,

- Week 5 - Lecture 1 - Friday, 3.00–5.00pm (GMT) 
- Week 6 - Class 1 - Thurday, 3.30–4.30pm (GMT) 
- Week 6 - Lecture 2 -  Friday, 3.00–5.00pm (GMT)

I will also schedule revision sessions in Trinity Term for students who wish to talk through sample essay topics and to prepare for exams. These dates are TBD. Watch this space.

**Organisation**

This module is composed of four blocks, each with a distinct theme. Main topics are covered in the main two-hour lecture; and the supplementary one-hour class will delve more in-depth into a topic. From the Block 2 and onwards, students will have the opportunity to present papers in the one-hour extra classes.

- __Block 1:__ Introducing the ideas of industrial policy and its relationship to industrial development. 

- __Block 2:__ Dynamic externalities and learning-by-doing. 

- __Block 3:__ Network externalities, linkages, and clusters. 

- __Block 4:__ The role of trade activity and trade policy as means of industrial development. 

The contents of these blocks may change slightly. So keep an eye on this live syllabus. I will announce substantive changes as they arise.

## Office Hours, Communication, & Advising.

__E-Mail__ - It always helps to refer to the module name in the header of your mail (__"Industrial Policy Class..."__). 

I do my best to answer e-mails quickly. If for some reason you do not get a response, just nudge me. Especially with remote teaching, things can fall through the cracks. You can also reach out to me of the Teams Group as well. 

__Office Hours__  -  I will hold regular teaching office hours each week. You do not need an appointment to see me during offce hours. I will provide a link to the Zoom office hours room for this. 

- Week 6 - Thursday, 5:30 PM - 6:30 PM 
- Week 7 - Thursday, 5:30 PM - 6:30 PM 
- Week 8 - Thursday, 5:30 PM - 6:30 PM 
- Week 9 - Thursday, 5:30 PM - 6:30 PM 

You can also schedule individual Zoom meetings with me for more extensive discussions. Just email me.

*********

## Lecture Topics and Schedule

__The main lecture each week__ will consist of a two-hour session. These lectures will usually be broken into two topics or so. Please note that the lectures may cover additional papers and omit some of those on the list.

__The extra class__ following each main lecture, we will dive into a topic deeper with a one-hour class. 

- Classes for Weeks 5 and 6 will be discussion based.

- Classes Week 7, 8 (Thurs.), and 8 (Sat.), you there are presentation slots available. These classes will be a chance for you to also book a twenty-minute summary and discussion of one of the topic papers we cover. Choose any you like. Or if you find one that is related and cool, let me know, and we can have you present it.


### Readings

Readings are broken down by those required for the command of lecture material, and the other stuff. 

Don't panic about seeing a lot of class material. Much of it is for you own reading and review. We're scholars, so we're pedantic. 

Lectures draw extensively from _required readings_. _Suggested readings_ can also appear in lectures, but you don't have to read those. If you track the required readings you will be set.

_Further readings_ are for those who want to get into the weeds of a topic. Or if you want to troll my knowledge in class. 

If you are in doubt about what reading to do, just ask me. I will try to post slides and/or notes after the two-hour lectures. 


### Part  1 - Concepts, Controversies, and the State

**Lecture Readings**

Introduction to industrial policy as a concept–-and the controversies surrounding it. The goal of this class will be to organize the taxonomy of the justifications for (and against) these interventions. Specifically, the various market failures and imperfections that are justifications for these policies.

### Part  2 - Dynamic externalities and learning-by-doing.

**Lecture Readings**

In this section we get more precise about a set of key externalities underlying arguments for industrial policy for industrial development. We focus on two types of externalities associated with justifications of industrial policy: learning-by-doing and scale economies. The latter, is an entry point into thinking about place-based policies.

### Part  3 - Externalities - Network Linkages, Clusters, and Foreign Direct Investment

**Lecture Readings**

The old and new: linkages. Linkages have an old idea in development economics. How to think about them, what do they mean, what is current work saying? This will include how to think the practicalities of the input-output table, and how they&#39;re used in discussing industrial policy practice. We will used the old idea of linkages to also consider the role they play in foreign direct investment (FDI).

**Lecture Readings**

Industrial development and trade have a long history. They&#39;re innately intertwined. Here we talk about the industrial policy in terms of trade policy. Principally by juxtaposing import substitution verses export promotion. The discussion of export-focused IP dovetails with our discussion of.
